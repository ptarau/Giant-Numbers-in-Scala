/**
 * This package tests out ideas about a tree-based number
 * representation that can host gigantic numbers, for instance
 * "towers of exponents" and sparse combinations of them,
 * in a compressed form.
 *
 * It also provides compact representation for numbers in their close
 * neighborhoud like Mersenne and Fermat numbers as well as numbers
 * derived from them like the "perfect numbers", equal to the
 * sum of their proper divisors.
 *
 * For instance, the largest known prime number (at the end of year 2012),
 * the Mersenne prime 2^43112609 âˆ’ 1 is represented as a small tree:
 *
 * V(W(T,[
 *   V(V(T,[]),[]),T,T,T,W(T,[]),V(T,[]),T,W(T,[]),W(T,[]),T,V(T,[]),T,T
 * ]),[])
 *
 * in contrast with the millions digits needed by its
 * conventional representation.
 *
 * Towards this end, we are using a "run-length" compressed
 * bijective base-2 representation for both 0 and 1 symbols.
 *
 * We see adding a 0 (represented as O) and 1 (represented as I)
 * as the application of a function.
 *
 * Numbers in bijective base 2 can be seen as finite strings of
 * made of the symbols O and I, elements of {O,I}*. O and I will
 * be seen here as generalized "constructors/extractors" using
 * Scala's apply/unapply methods.
 *
 * The key intuition is that each application of O(x) corresponds to
 * the function x->2x+1 and each application of I(x) to the function
 * x->2x+2. Our representation can be seen as describing natural
 * numbers in terms of itarated applications of these functions.
 *
 * In terms of the data type AlgT = T | V AlgT [AlgT] | W AlgT [AlgT]
 * - T represents the empty sequence
 * - V x xs represents an alternation of Os and Is
 *   where the first is an O, such x and each element of xs
 *   are counters starting with 0 (represented as T)
 * - W x xs represents an alternation of Is and Os
 *   where the first is an I, such x and each element of xs
 *   are counters starting with 0 (represented as T)
 *
 *   the "counters" are recursively represented the same way,
 *   such that the resulting trees/DAGs have internal nodes of type
 *   V or W and leves of type T
 *
 * We first implement various arithmetic operations on unbounded
 * natural numbers and then derive, using their Calkin-Wilf bijection
 * to rational numbers, and an extension to signed rationals
 * a possibly practical complete set of operations on them.
 * The bijection with naturals ensures that rational numbers are
 * stored at their information theoretical miniumum.
 *
 * The main open question is if, by using our representations,
 * there are significantly faster algorithms for some interesting
 * arithmetic functions and if interesting natural numbers or sequences
 * have significantly more compact forms.
